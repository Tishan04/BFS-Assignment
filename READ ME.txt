I have tested my code in the terminal. I have used the sample test cases given in the assignment and 
tried some of my inputs to further clarify how it handles different inputs and things. The output given
from my code is identical to what was given in the assignment explanation document.


HOW TO EXECUTE THE PROGRAM.
METHOD 01
1. Open the terminal and change the current directory to BFS directory.
2. Compile the program using the command: gcc bfs.c 
3. Run the program: ./a.out

METHOD 02
1. Same as METHOD 01
2. Compile the program by typing: makefile
3. Run the program: ./bfs
4. To remove the compiled executable files, type: clean


Eventhough we have allocated 100 nodes, we are only using 26 as per the number of capital letters in the
alphabet. Therefore my code will not work for inputs with double letters like AA or AB. The reason is I 
have used the data type char when reading from the file and then printing also.
My program assumes that the first node in the node list is the starting node of the traversal logic.
